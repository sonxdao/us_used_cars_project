This project examines used car prices in the US.

The data is collected from Kaggle's data source: US Cars'data was scraped from AUCTION EXPORT.com. This dataset included Information about 28 brands of clean and used vehicles for sale in US. Twelve features were assembled for each car in the dataset. The link to the data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset

In this project, we are interested in how car prices are affected based on their mileage, title status, and year. Our hypothesis is higher mileage and/or salvage title and/or older cars will have lower resale prices. We will look at the relationship between car prices and their title status, regress car prices on mileage (OLS), and regress car prices on mileage, title status, and year(OLS).

We then interpret our findings to see if our null hypothesis is true.
